### Introduction

> We plan to create an online web application that can be used to host and play games of both pongo and bingo both in person at the hosted bingo event and also simultaneously online so players can play from home. The areas this project will cover include data security, UI Design, front-end and back end using javascript or python.

### Outline

> The proposed project is creating a complete online bingo application that allows for two types of users: hosts and players. This bingo system will allow hosts to create and schedule bingo games for a given night with some level of customizability such as prize money and stake for players. The player however will be able to play bingo and pongo on the system under the hosts scheduled game and will allow for a tally of credit to be added onto each user. The purpose of this project is to make bingo halls and other bingo providers (GAA Clubs, Charity fundraisers and more) more accessible to users by not limiting the player base to people who only physically attend the event therefore increasing profits/money generated by the organisations.

### Background

> The project idea is based around the rise of online bingo and the rise in use of bingo as a fundraising game for local GAA clubs and charities. Since Covid-19 physical bingo halls have also struggled due to the elderlys concern about Covid-19, We have experienced this first hand with our local bingo hall in Dundalk currently being up for sale. Due to this we would like to create an application that is capable of allowing local communities such as GAA clubs to be able to host these Bingo games and not be limited to physical bingo and allow players to play from all over the world if necessary, this could also be done by traditional bingo halls to help allow the elderly players who still fear illness or maybe who are too unwell to physically attend the bingo hall still be able to play regularly.

### Achievements

> There would be two classifiable groups of people who would use this application. We will call them the hosts and the players. The project will provide a complete platform to allow hosts to create and host their own customisable bingo games. It will also provide players with the ability to play bingo remotely if they are unable to attend the event in person for whatever reasons. The people we would expect to utilise the role of hosts within this application would be Bingo businesses such as bingo halls and organisations that use bingo to fundraise such as GAA Clubs. The people we would expect to use this application under the player role would be people who enjoy playing bingo or wish to support a cause when it is used as a fundraising tool.

### Justification

> We decided on this project as it will be helpful to modernise the current standards of bingo systems within the world and allow for more access through the ability to play remotely. It will be useful in many different situations but the main one we came across was the high probability that not everyone can attend events in person and this allows for more accessibility as aforementioned. This would be useful in a few situations such as Bingo halls struggling or charities/organisations trying to fundraise. So in totality the justification behind the creation of the bingo application is that it will allow a higher level of accessibility to players and organisations/businesses who run bingo games.


### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.
  The programming languages we plan to use are javascript, MySQL, the back-end may be programmed using either python or javascript.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.
  We plan to use java script maybe react for the front end with some specific UI javascript librarys. We also will plan to use websockets to interact the client with the server. We will be using MySql database to store users information. Possibly using AWS to host server.

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.
  There will be non-standard hardware require as this will be a web application.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.
  We are not too familiar with javascript due to limited use in our course, we will also have to learn websockets in javascript. Cyber security is another area wich will be new to us but its also crucial to our project due to us handling users information.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.

#### Student 1

> Will be looking into front-end javascript, Ui librarys, cyber-security, testing (potentially in person due to ties with a local bingo hall), project research.

#### Student 2

> Will be looking into back-end javascript/python, also looking into AWS to host app, Cyber-security and testing, project research.
