In the split section of the video the top screen is the player and the bottom screen is the host, We only displayed the game up until the single line as their is time constraints on the video, we also muted the audio after the first number called to allow ourselves to explain what was happening
Some of the screen is cut off this is so we could show both screens at once, all that is missing within the video is the prompts we mention in the video
